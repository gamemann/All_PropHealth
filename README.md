# Description
After thinking of ideas on how to make CS:GO Zombie Mod more enjoyable, I finally decided to make a prop's health SourceMod plugin. I do believe there were and still are easier ways to make this plugin. However, I found this way being the most efficient for my needs. I will be updating this plugin and adding an even more advanced configuration setup.
